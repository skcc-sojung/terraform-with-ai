### Prompt
> Create a Terraform script to create an AWS NAT Gateway with the following specifications: 
>  - Name: osj-terraform-with-{aq | cp}-nat
>  - Subnet: osj-terraform-with-{aq | cp}-pub-a
>  - Connection type: Public
>  - Elastic IP allocation ID: Select "Elastic IP allocation"


### Response
To create an AWS NAT Gateway with the specified requirements, you can use the following Terraform script. This script builds upon the existing `main.tf` file in the `copilot` directory.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-northeast-2"
}

/* ... */

resource "aws_eip" "nat_eip" {
  vpc = true

  tags = {
    Name = "osj-terraform-with-cp-eip"
  }
}

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat_eip.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.subnet1.id

  tags = {
    Name = "osj-terraform-with-cp-nat"
  }

  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.igw]
}
```

### Prompt
> I want to create a Terraform script to create an AWS NAT Gateway.
In the AWS Console, when creating a NAT Gateway, clicking the orange "Allocate Elastic IP" button allocates a new IP address.
I want to avoid allocating a new Elastic IP in Terraform. Instead, I want to retrieve the ID of an existing Elastic IP that is already created in my AWS account and assign it to the NAT Gateway. How can I achieve this in Terraform?

### Response
To use an existing Elastic IP in Terraform, you can use the aws_eip data source to retrieve the ID of the existing Elastic IP and then assign it to the NAT Gateway. Here's how you can achieve this:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-northeast-2"
}

/* ... */

data "aws_eip" "existing_eip" {
  public_ip = "YOUR_EXISTING_EIP_PUBLIC_IP"
}

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat" {
  allocation_id = data.aws_eip.existing_eip.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.subnet1.id

  tags = {
    Name = "osj-terraform-with-cp-nat"
  }

  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.igw]
}

```

Replace `YOUR_EXISTING_EIP_PUBLIC_IP` with the public IP address of the existing Elastic IP you want to use. This script retrieves the ID of the existing Elastic IP and assigns it to the NAT Gateway.
